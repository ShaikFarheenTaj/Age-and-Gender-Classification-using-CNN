# Age-and-Gender-Classification-using-CNN
Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the automatic classification of age and gender from facial images. Recognizing gender and age can reveal important information about a personâ€™s affective state, cognitive activity, intention, personality, and psychopathology, making it a valuable tool for natural human-machine interfaces, behavioral science, and clinical practice.

Key Features
Face Detection and Localization: Detect and locate faces within cluttered scenes.

Facial Feature Extraction: Extract relevant facial features for analysis.

Age and Gender Classification: Classify both age and gender using advanced CNN techniques.

Project Approach
This project leverages CNNs to enhance the accuracy of age and gender classification by integrating gender-specific age characteristics. Recognizing that gender classification is typically simpler due to fewer potential classes and more pronounced intra-gender facial variations, this approach trains separate age classifiers for each gender. This separation leads to improved classification performance for age estimation.

Working
Face Detection: Identify and locate faces in images.

Feature Extraction: Extract facial features from detected faces.

Gender Classification: Determine the gender of the individual.

Age Classification: Estimate the age of the individual, with separate classifiers for each gender to enhance accuracy.
